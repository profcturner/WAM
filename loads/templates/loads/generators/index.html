<h2>Activity Generators</h2>

<p>Activity Generators are used to allocated activities to a numbers of staff members at the same time. The created activities
  are linked in an Activity Set, if the Set is deleted all those related Activities will be deleted as well. Note that each
  time you generate activities another set is created, the old one is <strong>not</strong> deleted. This is to allow you to,
  for instance, add multiple PhD supervisions. You can change the target groups and users between each generation. You can
  change other details too, but this is not recommended, better to create another generator.
</p>
