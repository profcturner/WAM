<h2>Migrate WorkPackage</h2>

<p>
This tool allows for custom activities, modules, and allocations of staff to modules to
be copied from one WorkPackage to another. It is, for safety reasons, not possible to
copy to a destination WorkPackage which already contains any of these items.
</p>

<p>
The normal use for this functionality is to roll the allocation from one year to another
so that it can then be edited appropriately for the next year.
<strong>This is still quite experimental, and this not in the navigation.</strong>
