<h2>Create External Examiner User</h2>

<p>This form allows the creation of new External Examiners. You should leave the password fields blank if your system
allows login of remote users. Ask your site admin if you are unsure. You will need to add the Examiner to a Package,
    but also then add them to a Programme before they will see it.
<strong>Note that the username will usually be a staff number</strong>
