Prototype workload allocation modeller

This is a simple prototype django web app for working out approximate distribution of workload in a Higher Education environment.
It also has some ancillary features such as the ability to allocate short tasks and remind staff about their completion and track
module and exam QA processes.

## Free and Open Source Software

This is Free and Open Source Software. You are free to use it in your institution.

## Key Features

Some of the current key features of this software are:

* Allows staff, activities and models to be split into "Work Packages", which typically can be used for a given department in a given academic year. The model may vary from year to year.
* Promotes transparency by allowing those staff within the model to their workload in relation to their peers.
* Allows activities to be split across types and categories.
* Allows activities to be allocated against 1-3 semesters to help analyse loading across an academic year.
* Activities can be allocated by hours or percentages of overall time.
* Loading can be viewed by staff but also by modules to help identify gaps.
* Can store details on "projects" like Research Grants to add loading to relevant staff.
* Generators can be created to add workload to multiple users.

There are some additional features, which may eventually be split into a second app.

* Allows tasks to be set against individual staff or groups and self certification of completion.
* Can email staff task reminders
* Allows assessment and moderation items to be handled securely online.
