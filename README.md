# WAM
Workload Allocation Modeller, and Assessment Workflow System

WAM is a web app for helping to fairly and transparently distribute workload in a Higher Education environment, through handling teaching allocations, and recognition of research
and other admin workload. WAM also enable staff teams to quality assure assessments, with functionality for external examiners.
WAM also has the ability to allocate short tasks and remind staff about their completion, in order to assist them in time managements.


## Free and Open Source Software

This is Free and Open Source Software. You are free to use it in your institution. We can also provide end to end hosted solutions, offering WAM as Software as a Service.

## Key Features

Some of the current key features of this software are:

### Workload Allocation

* Allows staff, activities and models to be split into "Work Packages", which typically can be used for a given department in a given academic year. The model may vary from year to year.
* Promotes transparency by allowing those staff within the model to their workload in relation to their peers.
* Allows activities to be split across types and categories.
* Allows activities to be allocated against 1-3 semesters to help analyse loading across an academic year.
* Activities can be allocated by hours or percentages of overall time.
* Loading can be viewed by staff but also by modules to help identify gaps.
* Load charts allow comparison of staff workloads to help understand who may be overloaded and who may have capacity.
* Can store details on "projects" like Research Grants to add loading to relevant staff.
* Generators can be created to add workload to multiple users.

### Assessment Quality Assurance

* Allows teaching teams to upload assessments for a central source of truth
* Key stakeholders can sign off stages in the QA workflow with a complete audit trail
* The workflow is configurable for your institution, but a default workflow is provided
* Access is enabled for External Examiners
* Complex provision with multiple examiners allows for "Lead" Examiners for each module to more fairly and efficiently distribute these tasks.

### Task Management

* Allows tasks to be set against individual staff or groups and self certification of completion.
* Can email staff task reminders to allow them to plan their time ahead for tasks that are due for completion soon, and those with longer lead times.
* Staff may self certify completion of tasks, with an audit trail
